# Welcome to your goQode project

This is a Vite (React + TS) project generated by goQode.

**URL**: [Your goQode Project URL]

This project is a fully-functional React application that you can edit and deploy.

### How it works

**Use goQode**

Simply visit your goQode Project and start prompting.

Changes made via goQode will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Work locally**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in goQode.

First, install the dependencies:

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server, usually at `http://localhost:8080`.
